Kamerous is a doomed project. (2 burned RPis!)

Idea: Blackbox with no need to connect, just put it outside, push the button and it'll take photos every second and store them. 
Additional wishes: Connect to local network and share photos (NFS tested and worked). Or later, do the image recognition and provide stream of time+what number do you see. Used for sports timing service.

HW:
- Raspberry Pi
- PiTFT Plus 3.5'' 480x320 touchscreen
- PiJuice HAT with 1200 mAh battery
- HQ camera
- fan

TODO: really good case to keep humidity outside
